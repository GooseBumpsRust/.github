We are comparing a syntax in Python with Rust.We will divide the information in chapters.And we would use a description for each  chapter, to help the user to get the idea how to use rust.

After that we will provide a "challenge", that would contain an easy task that could be immediately  solved and checked with build-in compiler.To inspire and keep active users, we will use NFT-banches as a reward
